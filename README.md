# WebGL-Tracer
## Why?
I have been interested in ray-tracing for years, seeing videos fly past on Youtube of people actually accomplishing in creating real-time versions of it, although simetimes simplistic but still functional.
I always wanted to do the same, although I might not be as good at programming, it is one of the milestones I set early on but never was able to complete in a way I wanted it to be.

## Why JS?
Heres a short list of the positives it has:
 - Memory is managed for you by the JIT-compiler
 - Good error info compared to C++ where it can be really cryptic on what actually went wrong
 - Easy to use OpenGL implementation built-in to most browsers
 
## What is its purpose?
 - Creating a ray-tracing web-engine
 - Checking if I have improved my skills over the years
 - Seeing if I can see this through without starting over with my dozen or so earlier projects
 - Maybe being able to use this to teach others how to code

## Used libraries
 - Browsers WebGL implementation

## Status
Early development!
There is no actual tracing done yet, I am still developing the backend parts to make sure the shaders get the info they need later on when actual tracing is being done
